this is my idea for the demo, in order to have a goal for what to do for Thursday.

The demo will have four items. A consumable key, a non consumable crowbar, gold,
and a rod of success.
Keys open doors.
Crowbar opens crates.
Coins effect score.
Rod of success wins game when placed on pedestal.

There will be one NPC named guide. When spoken to He will give general how to
play information.

The map will comprise of six rooms.
The layout will look like this:
                            -------------------------
                            |room:treasure chamber  |

                            |item:rod of success    |
                            |:crate must be smashed:|
                            |:the rod must be taken:|
                            -------------------------

                            |:crowbar must be taken:|
                            |:door must be unlocked:|
                            -------------------------

                            -------------------------   -------------------------
                            |room:entrance to cave  |   |room:gatehouse         |
                            |object:cave door       |   |object:desk            |
                            |items:none             |   |item:key               |
                            |NPC:guide              |   |                       |
                            |:door must be unlocked:|   |:key needs to be taken:|
                            -------------------------   -------------------------

The objects are defined per room, doors are objects that take keys, crates take
crowbar, and pedestal takes rod of success. I will make a victory object, derived
from interactive that will "win" the game when activated. Spread amounts of gold 
around the map, in crates where the player might not usually go after getting the
crowbar, and the total gold the player ends up with will be displayed after the game
is won.

The descriptions of objects should vaguely hint at what should be done to them. 
The description will only be displayed when look at directly, so the input 
"look at pedestal"
would display something like 
"There is a pedestal in the center of the room with a round slot on top. You get the
feeling something grand would happen if you put the right thing in the slot."
"look at crate"
would say something like
"There's a crate against the Northern wall. I bet there's nice stuff in it, if only
you could pry it open..."
"look at desk"
"You rummage through the drawers, but find nothing of a useful quality."
"look at door"
"This door bars your way. Surely there's a key somewhere..."
"look at stalactites"
etc.

Rooms will have a description that displays when you enter them, or type "look"
so make appropriate descriptions.

Items will similarly have descriptions, vaguely referencing their use. For example,
"look at rod" could say "It seems like it would fit inside something..."

That is everything we need to cover for the purpose of the demo, I think.
