Issues

Issue #1 -      resolved? [no]
If the markup file does not exist, the game crashes because somewhere we're reading from a NULL pointer. This happens first in Game::look().
We take the current room pointer (map.get_current_room()) which returns NULL because no room has been loaded up from the markup.
   We can fix this by adding a check each time we use get_current_room(). For example,
	// let's try this instead
	// stringstreams are really powerful
	stringstream ss;
	string line, command;

        // something like this
        room* currentRoom = map.get_current_room();
        if (currentRoom == NULL)
        {
                exCout << "We're sorry. The game did not load properly.\n";
                gameover = true;
                return;
        }
        // reference currentRoom everywhere else down here...
        
	getline(cin, line);
	ss.str(line); // replace (empty) contents of stringstream with line input from console
	ss >> command;
	if (command == "look")
	{
		command.clear();
		ss >> command;
		if (command == "at")

Issue #2 -      resolved [yes]
      Endlines in the Game::getInput need to be fixed. I made some changes to the output in gamemap to conform to standards for the look operation. It threw off the endlines a little bit.

Issue #3 -     resolved [yes]
      Console attribute needs to be reset to normal after printing out door locked message in Game::getInput.
