Instructions for GitHub

origin: https://github.com/RogerGee/AdventureGame.git
working branch: [just] master

Get lastest version:
	- do this before working on project so that everything is up-to-date
	$ git pull origin master

Commit your changes locally:
	- do this when you edit/create file
	$ git add <file-name>
	- then commit
	$ git commit -m "Type a descriptive message that represents your changes."
	- shorthand: add and commit in one fell swoop (I want to say this only adds existing, but edited files in the repo)
	$ git commit -am "message"

Push your changes (what you have committed) to the server:
	$git push origin master

Step-by-Step
	$ git pull origin master
		then
	$ git add IChangedThisFile.ext
		or
	$ git add IAddedThisNewFile.ext
		then
	$ git commit -m "These are the changes that I made!"
		now that you've committed, you can push to the server
	$ git push origin master

Setting up git for the first time
	- set up your username and/or email
		- this is a global setting that is applied once
		$ git config --global user.name "My name is..."
		- this is important - it's what will show up with your commits
	- create a new directory for the project
	- change prompt (current working directory) to project directory
	- run
		$ git init
		- this initializes the working directory as a git directory
	- set up the origin
		- add "origin" as an alias for the project URI (so that you don't have to type it each time)
		$ git remote add origin https://github.com/RogerGee/AdventureGame
		- note (I believe) the URI is case-sensitive
	- pull down the repo
		$ git pull origin master
