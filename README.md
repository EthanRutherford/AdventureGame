## Design Assignment Description
"Describe the classes you expect you might need to create an adventure story game. Your description should include the attributes (variables) your classes will contain ("has a") and the actions (functions). Remember C++ objects can do more than the real object they represent--for example, a room might know if it has been visited, whereas in "real life" usually that information would be "saved" in the person, not the room."
