Hello Dr. Prather!

Please use the batch to compile (you can add fatal back in, if you need to make sure it compiles
with all warning flags, I removed it for testing purpses) if you wish to see everything we
worked on (text wrapping and color coded output).

After that, you can run it by either running and then typing the name of the game file you
you wish to play (demogame.txt or ethanrgame.txt) or dragging the txt file onto the exe (or
passing it as a command line parameter).

I recommend playing ethanrgame (because it's the only one that's finished, we were originally
all going to make one, but only I finished in time), and so talk to Gyde until he has no more
information. He should give you enough information to get through.

Enjoy!
